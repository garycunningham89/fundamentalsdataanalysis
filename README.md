# Assignment for Fundamentals of Data Analysis
# Submission Date - 29th November 2019
# Lecturer - Ian McLoughlin
# Objective - 
# As per Assignment sheet;-


# To complete assignment the following base plan was created.
# a) Learn how to create a jupyter notebook and detail steps.
# b) Create the notebook and add to git repository.
# c) Expand on previous learnings of Python including the newer lecture content concerning the numpy.random package.
# d) Use new learnings and the jupyter notebook to complete the four tasks above.
# e) Complete Assignment to a suitable standard as per requirements outlined in the assignment sheet within the repository.
# Step Description


# Key Words
# Jupyter - "a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python, and R" (Datacamp, 2019) - The base languages jupyter was created to include but it now includes various other languages, including Python.
# Notebook - jupyter notebook versions allow the inclusion of code, graphs, figures, etc. in a single document repository and Datacamp (2019) state these document holdings "are the ideal place to bring together an analysis description, and its results, as well as, they can be executed perform the data analysis in real time".
# The Jupyter Notebook App - allows running the program on a web browser with the kernel and dashboard the primary components. The kernel deals with the code inputted by the user. The dashboard shows the high level of this access and allows creation or editing of notebooks and managing of kernels on the system you are using.
