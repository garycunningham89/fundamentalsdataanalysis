# Assignment for Fundamentals of Data Analysis
# Submission Date - 29th November 2019
# Lecturer - Ian McLoughlin
# Objective - 
# As per Assignment sheet, marks to be awarded in conjuction with;-

# Description - Uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips dataset. This part is worth 30%.
# Regression: Analyse whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount. Also 30%.
# Analyse: Analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset, in any way. 40% of mark.

# To complete assignment the following base plan was created.
# a) Learn how to create a jupyter notebook and detail steps.
# b) Create the notebook and add to git repository.
# c) Expand on previous learnings of Python including the newer lecture content concerning the numpy.random package.
# d) Use new learnings, utilize the various packages and the jupyter notebook to complete the tasks.
# e) Complete Assignment to a suitable standard as per requirements outlined in the assignment sheet within the repository.

# Key Steps for Completion of Assignment;
# Create Notebook.
# Add to Github.
# Gain and Anyalyse Sources.
# Research Tips Set.
# Add to Notebook.
# Create Description.
# Input various codings, explanations and graphs.
# Research Regression.
# Compose regression learnings on Tips set and relevant workings.
# Analyse tips set uniquely.
# Complete the assignment to standard.

# Key Words
# Jupyter - "a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python, and R" (Datacamp, 2019) - The base languages jupyter was created to include but it now includes various other languages, including Python.
# Notebook - jupyter notebook versions allow the inclusion of code, graphs, figures, etc. in a single document repository and Datacamp (2019) state these document holdings "are the ideal place to bring together an analysis description, and its results, as well as, they can be executed perform the data analysis in real time".
# The Jupyter Notebook App - allows running the program on a web browser with the kernel and dashboard the primary components. The kernel deals with the code inputted by the user. The dashboard shows the high level of this access and allows creation or editing of notebooks and managing of kernels on the system you are using.
